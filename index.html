      <p style="margin-left: 50px; color: white; font-size: 20px;">
        Our supreme leader is the pope. On the level with pope is princess. princess is pope's girlfriend. 
        Even tought pope and the princess have the right to decide about anything, our policy has been pretty open minded.
        Down from pope and princess comes people who pope elect. People who pope elects can elect lower ranked mods, and so on.
